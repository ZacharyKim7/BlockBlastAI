# What is BlockBlast?
[Block Blast](https://blockblast.org/) is a Tetris-inspired game where players freely drop pieces onto an board with the goal of completing both rows and columns, upon which they disappear and add to the game score. Players are given a choice of three pieces at a time. The game ends when the player is unable to place any of the current pieces.

# Project Overview
